# About Me
Hi, I'm **@tndt____**, the girl behind **fluei.xia**. 
I'm someone who finds joy in making handmade gifts, because my love language is *gift-giving*. 
There's something magical about creating something with my own hands and seeing it appreciated by someone else - it's a quiet but powerful kind of happiness.

## A little more about me
I love crafting in many forms: making paper flowers, painting, coloring, and even painting little plaster figures. 
But among all of those hobbies, crochet has become something really special to me.
I started learning how to crochet in the summer of 2022, right after finishing my high school graduation exams. 
One of my close friends had to move to Da Nang for university, and I wanted to give her something meaningful. 
So, I challenged myself to learn crochet in just one week. 
That week was full of tangled yarn and moments when I almost gave up, but in the end, I managed to finish a bouquet of tulips. 
It wasn't perfect, but it was made with love - and that made it worth everything.

## About fluei.xia
**fluei.xia** is a name I came up with back in 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic. 
At first, it was just a little username where I posted my drawings. 
But later, when I started crocheting, I continued sharing my work there - from photos to little crochet videos. 
It's grown with me and my creativity ever since.

## My logo
<div style={{ width: '25%', margin: '0 auto' }}>
  <img src={require("./img/logo-trans.png").default} style={{ width: '100%', height: 'auto' }} />
</div>

My logo is a pink heart with the number **121%**. 
The pink heart represents sweetness and softness - a reflection of how I want my crafts to feel. 
The number *121* comes from my birthday, October 12, and also stands for how I want people to feel when they receive my handmade gifts: **121% happy**, overflowing with joy.  

*Thank you for being here, and I hope something you see on this blog brings you inspiration, warmth, or a little spark of happiness.*
