# August and the first strand of yarn

Mid-August was approaching, and big changes were coming. 
Thịnh was about to leave for the U.S. to study abroad, and Oanh would be heading back to Đà Nẵng for university. 
I started thinking about farewell gifts for them - and out of nowhere, I remembered crochet.

Wait… hadn't I tried learning crochet back in grade 5? I never got the hang of it back then. 
I had also once thought about picking up knitting after high school. 
So I thought, why not give crochet another shot now?  

But there were only a couple of days left before Thịnh's farewell - definitely not enough time to make something for him. 
Oanh, on the other hand, still had about a week, so maybe I could manage to finish something by then.  

On August 11, we had a farewell meal for Thịnh. 
Before that, I stopped by this little yarn shop near our high school and picked up some supplies. 
That very night, I started teaching myself how to crochet.  

Honestly, it was rough in the beginning. 
I couldn't even tell the stitches apart when trying to do a single crochet. 
I kept messing up the count. But slowly, I started to get the hang of it.  

Over the next few days, I realized that if I wanted to make plushies, I had to learn how to do a magic ring. 
And let me tell you - that thing was a nightmare. 
I must've rewatched tutorial videos a dozen times and still couldn't get it right. 
There were a few moments where I just wanted to quit. But somehow, I pulled through.

At the time, those pig head plushies were all the rage. I looked up some patterns and tried to wing it using intuition. 
I didn't follow a video tutorial (there weren't any back then anyway), so I read the written pattern instead. 
Here's how my first pig head turned out:
<div style={{ width: '80%', margin: '0 auto' }}>
  {/* <img src={require("./image.png").default} style={{ width: '100%', height: 'auto' }} /> */}
</div>

After I got the basics down, I wanted to try making a small tulip bouquet and a bunny head. Here's how they looked:
<div style={{ width: '40%', margin: '0 auto' }}>
  <img src={require("./rabbit.jpg").default} style={{ width: '100%', height: 'auto' }} />
</div>

To be honest, I really loved the bouquet - but I've never been good at arranging flowers, so I wasn't totally satisfied with how it came together. 
Still, for a first attempt, I figured it wasn't too bad. 
A little rough around the edges, sure - but I reminded myself that what matters most is the thought and love that go into it.
